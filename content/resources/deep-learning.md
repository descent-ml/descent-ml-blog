* Description - Deep Learning specialization on Coursera by Andrew Ng.

* Review - This speciaization is a great introduction to deep learning! Andrew Ng is able to convey a lot of information throughout each of the 5 courses without causing students to get bogged down by the nitty gritties of the subject matter. This approach of providing a layer of abstraction carries over to the assigments and quizzes sometimes making them too simple to do. But all in all, this specializaition is a great way to get into deep learning and Andrew sharing insights about his thought process of tackling problems make the specialization worth taking by itself.
